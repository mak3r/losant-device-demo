Adopt the persona named in $ARGUMENTS and work through open issues and PRs until the session ends or no work remains.

**Autonomous operation**: Do not ask for confirmation at any point. Invoking this skill is authorization to do all the work. Never ask "want me to proceed?", "shall I work on this?", "should I fetch the issue?", or any similar question. Scan → pick → act, without pausing.

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` as one of:

| Form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `<persona>` | Work through items once, then stop |
| `<persona> <minutes>` | Work continuously, polling every ~4.5 min for `<minutes>` minutes |
| `<persona> until:<iso_timestamp>` | Work continuously until absolute deadline (used by self-scheduling wake-ups) |

Valid persona names: `developer`, `test-engineer`, `security`, `qa`, `gitops-manager`, `docs`, `merge-manager`, `product-designer`, `triage`

If the persona name is not in that list, stop immediately and print:
```
Unknown persona: "<name>". Valid personas: developer, test-engineer, security, qa, gitops-manager, docs, merge-manager, product-designer, triage
```
Do not proceed further.

On first call with `<minutes>`, compute `end_time = now + <minutes> minutes` as ISO 8601 UTC. Subsequent self-scheduled wake-ups pass `until:<end_time>` to preserve the deadline.

---

## Step 1 — Adopt the Persona

You ARE the `<persona>`. Read `CLAUDE.md` now to confirm:
- Which files you are allowed to modify
- Which branch you operate on
- Any hard rules that apply to this persona

**Branch validation by persona:**

- **developer**: Valid starting states are `develop` or `feature/developer/*`. If on `develop`, you will create a feature branch in Step 4 when picking up an issue. If on `feature/developer/<name>`, continue work on that branch. If on any other branch, stop and tell the user.
- **test-engineer**: Valid starting states are `develop`, `feature/developer/*`, or `persona/test-engineer`. You will select the correct branch in Step 2 based on available work. If on any other branch, stop and tell the user.
- **All other personas**: The current branch must match your persona's designated branch exactly. If not, tell the user which branch to switch to and stop.

If persona is `triage`: print "The triage persona is invoked via /triage, not /watch-work. Run /triage instead." and stop.

---

## Step 2 — Scan for Work (token-efficient, one pass)

> **Always fresh.** Do not rely on any prior in-session memory of what was "already handled" — the queue changes between runs. Treat every item returned by these queries as if you are seeing it for the first time. Verify current state from GitHub, not from conversation history.

> **test-engineer only — branch selection before scanning:**
> Run the issue and PR queries below first (without checking out anything yet), then apply this logic:
> 1. If there are open `feature/developer/*` PRs or issues labeled `persona/test-engineer` **and** `type/task` associated with a feature branch: prioritize those. Run `git fetch origin && git checkout feature/developer/<name>`.
> 2. Otherwise if there are issues labeled `persona/test-engineer` for test infrastructure work: run `git checkout persona/test-engineer && git pull`.
> 3. If both feature and infra work exist, choose feature work (bugs block shipping; infra can wait).
> 4. If no work exists, go to Step 5 (empty queue).

**Open issues assigned to this persona:**
```bash
gh issue list \
  --state open \
  --label "persona/<persona-name>" \
  --json number,title,labels,updatedAt \
  --limit 25 \
  --jq '.[] | "#\(.number)  \(.title)  \([.labels[].name] | join(","))  [updated \(.updatedAt[:10])]"'
```

**Open PRs needing this persona's attention:**

> If persona is `merge-manager`: fetch ALL open PRs targeting `develop` — the merge-manager reviews every PR, not just ones it owns.
> ```bash
> gh pr list \
>   --state open \
>   --base develop \
>   --json number,title,headRefName,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup,comments \
>   --limit 30 \
>   --jq '.[] | "#\(.number)  \(.title)  [\(.headRefName)]  review:\(.reviewDecision // "PENDING")  ci:\(if (.statusCheckRollup // [] | length) == 0 then "unknown" elif (.statusCheckRollup | all(.[]; .state == "SUCCESS")) then "green" else "failing" end)  comments:\(.comments | length)"'
> ```

> All other personas: fetch only PRs on their branch or where they are a requested reviewer.
> ```bash
> gh pr list \
>   --state open \
>   --json number,title,headRefName,reviewDecision,comments,reviewRequests \
>   --limit 30 \
>   --jq '[.[] | select(
>       (.headRefName | startswith("feature/developer/")) or
>       (.headRefName | startswith("persona/")) or
>       (.reviewRequests | length > 0)
>   )] | .[] | "#\(.number)  \(.title)  [\(.headRefName)]  review:\(.reviewDecision // "PENDING")  comments:\(.comments | length)"'
> ```

**Linked PRs for issues in your queue** — after the issue scan, for each issue number found (up to 5), check for linked PRs:
```bash
gh issue view <n>  # look for a "Pull requests:" section in the plain-text output
```
If a linked PR is listed, add it to the queue. These linked PRs are part of your work even if they are on a branch not matching your persona's prefix.

Print the combined issue + PR results as a brief queue, then proceed to Step 3.

---

## Step 3 — Pick the Highest-Priority Item

**If persona is `merge-manager`**, use this priority order:

| Priority | Condition |
|---|---|
| 1 | PR with `ci:green` and `review:APPROVED` — ready to merge now |
| 2 | PR with `ci:failing` — create or update a blocking issue labeled `persona/<owner>` and `type/bug` |
| 3 | PR with open `type/security` issues on its branch — comment that it is blocked |
| 4 | PR with `review:CHANGES_REQUESTED` — already handled by the owning persona; add a comment if stale |
| 5 | PR with `review:PENDING` and `ci:green` — leave a review |

**All other personas**, score every item and pick the highest. In case of a tie, prefer the oldest `updatedAt`.

| Priority | Condition |
|---|---|
| 1 | PR on your branch with `review:CHANGES_REQUESTED` — blocking a merge |
| 2 | PR where you are a requested reviewer — blocking the PR author |
| 3 | Issue labeled `type/bug` + `phase/1` |
| 4 | Issue labeled `type/bug` + `phase/2` (or higher) |
| 5 | Issue labeled `type/task` + `phase/1` |
| 6 | Issue labeled `type/task` + `phase/2` (or higher) |
| 7 | Anything else, oldest `updatedAt` first |

To extract phase from an issue's labels: look for a label matching `phase/<n>` and read `<n>` as an integer. If no phase label is present, treat it as phase 99 (lowest).

If the queue is empty, go to Step 5.

## Step 4 — Do the Work

Do not announce the item and wait. Fetch details and begin immediately.

For the selected item:

1. **Fetch full details:**
   - Issue: `gh issue view <n>` — scan the output for a "Pull requests:" section. If a linked PR appears, run `gh pr view <linked-pr-n> --comments` and treat that PR's branch as your working branch. Do not create a new branch or PR when an existing one already covers this issue.
   - PR (if picked directly): `gh pr view <n> --comments`

2. **Understand what's needed.** Read only the files required to complete the task — no broad codebase exploration.

3. **Make the changes** within your persona's designated file scope (from CLAUDE.md). Do not touch files owned by other personas.

   > **developer — branch lifecycle:**
   > - If currently on `develop`: derive a branch slug from the issue title and number (e.g. `feature/developer/123-add-node-metrics`), then run `git checkout -b feature/developer/<slug> origin/develop` before making any changes.
   > - After the PR for this issue is merged: `git checkout develop && git pull origin develop && git branch -d feature/developer/<slug>`.
   > - Start the next loop from `develop`.

   > **test-engineer — branch cleanup:**
   > - After completing work on a feature branch: push, then `git checkout develop && git pull origin develop`.
   > - After completing test-infra work on `persona/test-engineer`: push, then `git checkout develop && git pull origin develop`.
   > - Start the next loop from `develop`.

4. **Validate:**
   - If you modified `*.go` files: `make test`
   - If you modified manifests: `make manifests && git diff --exit-code config/rbac/role.yaml`
   - Docs/YAML changes: no build step required

5. **Commit** using conventional commit style:
   ```
   <type>(<scope>): <description>
   
   Closes #<issue-number>
   
   Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
   ```

5b. **Verify the commit SHA exists** — run `git rev-parse --verify <sha>` immediately after committing. Do not reference a SHA in any issue comment or PR description unless this command returns successfully. If the command fails, the commit did not happen — do not fabricate or guess a SHA.

5c. **Open a PR** (branch-owning personas only — all except `merge-manager` and `product-designer`): if no open PR already targets `develop` for this branch, open one now with `gh pr create`. Work is not done until a PR is open. Do not close the issue before the PR exists.

5d. **Handoff check** — before commenting on the issue, ask: does completing this work create a dependency for another persona? Common examples:
   - Security approves RBAC change → developer can now add the marker
   - Developer completes implementation → test-engineer can now write tests
   - PR is open and CI passes → merge-manager can review

   If yes, you must execute the handoff before marking the issue complete:
   - Re-label the current issue from `persona/<you>` to `persona/<next>` and comment with what was done and exactly what the next persona must do, OR
   - Create a new issue labeled `persona/<next>` with explicit instructions, then close your issue

   **Do not comment with a commit SHA or close the issue until the handoff action is complete.**

6. **Update the issue/PR:** comment must include all of the following — do not summarize or paraphrase, paste the actual output:
   - Output of `git log --oneline -1` (proves the commit exists with its real message and SHA)
   - PR URL (from `gh pr create` output or `gh pr view --json url --jq '.url'`)
   - For any file-level fix: output of a `grep` or `head` command confirming the change is present in the file (e.g. `grep '^FROM golang:' Dockerfile`)

   Fabricated or assumed output will be caught by the merge-manager. If you cannot produce real output, the commit did not happen — do not close the issue.

---

## Step 5 — Loop or Schedule

After completing an item (or finding an empty queue):

**Single-check mode** (no duration): stop and print a summary of what was completed.

**Watch mode:**
- Is `now < end_time`?
  - **Yes and work was just completed**: immediately return to Step 2 to check for more work.
  - **Yes and queue was empty**: call `ScheduleWakeup` with `delaySeconds: 270`, `reason: "Polling for new work for <persona>"`, `prompt: "Resume watch-work: you are the <persona> persona. Continue from Step 2 — scan for open issues and PRs, pick the highest-priority item, do the work, then loop. Session ends at <end_time_iso>. Do not use slash commands; invoke the watch-work skill directly via the Skill tool with skill name 'watch-work' and args '<persona> until:<end_time_iso>'."`
  - **No**: print `Session complete for <persona>. Items completed this session: <N>.` and stop.

---

## Token Efficiency Rules

1. `--json <field-list>` on every `gh` call — never omit the field list.
2. `--jq` on every list call — only formatted strings reach context, not raw JSON.
3. Read only files needed for the current task — no broad codebase exploration.
4. Never quote issue or PR body verbatim unless it is directly relevant to a code decision.
5. One issue-list call and one PR-list call per scan cycle, plus up to 5 `gh issue view` calls to discover linked PRs — no other exploration.
